This repository will provide the official code, pretrained models, and datasets for the paper:

**"Anti-fibrotic Electronic Epineurium for High-fidelity Chronic Peripheral Nerve Interface in Freely Moving Animals"**

In this work, we demonstrate high-accuracy behavior decoding using signals recorded from our novel electronic epineurium (e-Epi) interface.

## 🚀 Key Features (Coming Soon!)
- End-to-end **behavior decoding** pipeline using e-Epi signals
- Transformer-based deep learning models
- Lightweight linear models for comparison
- Dataset for freely moving animal nerve recordings
- Reproducible experiments & evaluation scripts
